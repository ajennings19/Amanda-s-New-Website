         	<b>Description</b>
					<br>
					General Assembly offers varrying formats of courses in tech, pioneering education and career transformation. In launching remote full-time formats of popular in-person courses, I was part of a team that developed a video campaign to drive awareness to the new online format.
					<br><br>
					The video narrative communicates the ease and flexibility of an online learning environment as well as how the core full-time course value prop — hands-on learning, collaboration, and career support — is the same in either format.

			<b>The Narrative:</b> Launch a high-growth career from anywhere with GA's award-winning Immersive courses, now available in an online format to fit your busy lifestyle. The video storyline shares the practical setup/tools of the Online learning environment as well as how the core full-time course value prop — hands-on learning, collaboration, and career support — is the same in either format. 
			<br><br>
			The narrative acknowledges the busy lifestyles of students and how full-time online course formats help accommodate them, highlights online learning without detracting from the on-campus experience, and is evergreen, with both top- and bottom-of-funnel use.
			<br><br>
			<b>The Visuals:</b> This campaign was developed amoungst a team of designers, copywriters, videographers, an illustrator, and an animator. My roles throughout the video's production included: concept creation, visual development, casting selection, wardrobe selection, art direction through-out the shoot, video QA, and marketing asset support creation. -->
