		<p>Amanda is a digital designer based in Brooklyn, NY. Originally from Connecticut, she studied graphic design at Southern Connecticut State University, photography & advertising while abroad at Napier University in Edinburgh, UK, and Front-End Web Development at General Assembly (which allowed her the skills to build this site!). Her interests include iced coffee year-round, fashion, being an ebay enthusiast, and discovering the best food around New York City. She has attention to detail, strong work ethic, and a sense of humor.</p>

<!-- <div class="grid col-1-2">
In past versions of General Assemblyâ€™s emails, the templates were inconsistent, did not follow brand guidelines, and were an OCD designer's nightmare. I was tasked to redesign all emails sent out by the company with the goal of creating one template that had transferable modules. The following designs were sent out as an A/B test against the prior versions of emails and the new designs resulted in higher results in a variety of categories.
